// We have set the 768 diemensions in vector DB (Pinecone). It means we searched based on semantics or relevancy.

// Phase 1: PDF or Document Loading
// Phase 2: Chunking
// Phase 3: Convert each chunk into vector
// Phase 4: Store the vectors in the vector DB (Pinecone)
// Phase 5: Query the vector DB (Pinecone)
// Phase 6: Retrieve the most semantic or relevancy chunks
// Phase 7: Generate the response

// So all these phases are done by the different various ways. So we can used the Langchain framework to do all these phases.
// Langchain is a utility tool which has a pre-build functions, modules and tools which ease our work basically.
